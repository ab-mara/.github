> [!WARNING]  
> **This organization has been archived and is no longer active.**

## Overview

This GitHub organization was originally established by Atlas Bear to house the **MARA** (Multi-source Analysis and Reporting Architecture) platform - our comprehensive intelligence system that follows the workflow: **Monitor, Analyze, Report, Act**.

MARA is Atlas Bear's integrated intelligence platform consisting of:

- **GIDA** (Global Intelligence and Data Almanac) - Comprehensive country database
- **CSER** (Comprehensive Security Event Repository) - Security incident tracking and analysis
- **TITAN** (Tactical Intelligence Targeting and Analysis Network) - Sensitive tactical intelligence management
- **ATLAS** (Asset Tracking, Liaison, and Source System) - Field intelligence network management

## New Location

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **All MARA development and documentation has been consolidated into our main organization:**
> 
> ### â†’ [atlas-bear/mara](https://github.com/atlas-bear/mara)

This consolidation allows us to maintain all Atlas Bear projects, including our "AB Labs" initiatives, under a single organizational structure for better collaboration and resource management.
